# Flower_classification_DataAugmentation_TransferLearning

Utilized Flower images dataset from GoogleAPI :-
 "https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz".

Classified 5 types of flower images :
'roses','daisy','dandelion','sunflowers','tulips'

CNN results in 63% accuracy so used Data_Augmentation with dropout layer which improved accuarcy to 70%.

Implemented Transfer Learning with MobilenetV2 pretained model and acheived 92% of accuracy.
